## About the dataset:

This dataset contains medical information related to hypertension and cardiovascular health. Each row represents data for a single patient, including demographic information, medical measurements, and diagnostic test results.

### Fields Description:

1. **age (int)**: The age of the patient in years.
2. **sex (int)**: The gender of the patient. (Typically 0 for female and 1 for male, but confirm with the dataset documentation.)
3. **cp (int)**: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient. Commonly encoded as:
   - 0: No chest pain
   - 1: Typical angina
   - 2: Atypical angina
   - 3: Non-anginal pain
   - 4: Asymptomatic
4. **trestbps (int)**: Blood pressure level of the patient in mmHg.
5. **chol (int)**: Cholesterol level of the patient in mg/dL.
6. **fbs (int)**: Indicator if the patient's fasting blood sugar level is greater than 120 mg/dL. (0: No, 1: Yes)
7. **restecg (int)**: Resting electrocardiographic results. Commonly encoded as:
   - 0: Normal
   - 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
   - 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. **thalach (int)**: The maximum heart rate achieved by the patient during exercise in beats per minute.
9. **exang (int)**: Indicator if the patient experienced exercise-induced angina. (0: No, 1: Yes)
10. **oldpeak (double)**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (a measure of ischemia).
11. **slope (int)**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment. Commonly encoded as:
    - 0: Upsloping
    - 1: Flat
    - 2: Downsloping
12. **ca (int)**: The number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **thal (int)**: Type of defect observed in the heart scan. Commonly encoded as:
    - 0: No defect
    - 1: Normal defect
    - 2: Fixed defect
    - 3: Reversible defect
14. **target (int)**: Indicator if the patient has hypertension. (0: No, 1: Yes)

### Potential Uses of the Dataset

This dataset can be used for various analyses and applications such as:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Understanding the distribution and central tendencies of each field.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different variables, such as age and blood pressure, cholesterol levels and heart rate, etc.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building models to predict outcomes like the presence of hypertension or risk of heart disease based on the other variables.
- **Comparative Studies**: Comparing different subgroups within the dataset, such as patients with and without hypertension, or different types of chest pain.
